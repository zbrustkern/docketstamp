# Send My Notes

> **A thoughtful gesture made seamless. Your words, real pen and ink, mailed for you.**

## Start here: canonical project context

**Founder decisions established October 11, 2026.** All project participants
should read the [canonical project brief](docs/CANONICAL_PROJECT_BRIEF.md) and
[canonical product specifications](docs/CANONICAL_PRODUCT_SPECS.md) first.

- **Audience:** personal senders, 100%.
- **Value:** a thoughtful gesture made seamless. Customization contributes to
  thoughtfulness; stationery quality supports it.
- **Brand:** SendMyNotes serves the sender. Aster & Blanche is the recipient-facing
  stationery identity and landing page, with its small optional sending funnel.
  The intended redesign removes A&B from the SendMyNotes customer experience.
- **Baseline:** zero independent customer conversions. The one paid order was the
  founder's test. Apple Pay remains untested despite a successful Stripe payment.
- **Verified format:** Handwrytten A2 folded portrait, **4.25 × 5.5 inches**.
  Exact paper weight and complete supplier cost remain unconfirmed.
- **Photos:** authorized for marketing only after personal information is excluded
  or redacted and the exported asset is visually reviewed.

The [Handwrytten audit](docs/HANDWRYTTEN_INTEGRATION_AUDIT.md) records live catalog
verification and required alignment. For full architecture, state machines, and commerce engine details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

**Architecture & Technical Documentation:** [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
contains the authoritative system overview, order lifecycle, Stripe/wallet integration,
environment secrets, and the "Clone & Carve" forking checklist.

## Overview

**Send My Notes** helps personal senders choose or create a card, write their own
message, and have it penned and mailed for them from their phone. Aster & Blanche
is the physical stationery identity. The experience aims to make sending quick
and effortless; the 60-second target has not been measured as a customer baseline.

Behind the scenes, the **Handwrytten API** selects an A2 folded portrait card and
submits the message for real-pen writing and postal fulfillment. See the canonical
specification sheet for confirmed dimensions, supplier timing guidance, and
remaining paper/envelope questions.

## Key Features

* **Live Card Preview:** On-screen visualization of the card and note. Exact physical geometry and wrapping require alignment with verified A2 specifications.
* **Natural Note Composer:** Unified single-field authoring (salutation, sentiment, closing, signature) with an instant smart shuffle across 11 occasions and 4 distinct tones.
* **Curated Calligraphy:** Defaults to authentic adult handwriting scale (**Casual David / `hwDavid`** at ~4mm letter height and ~8.5mm line spacing).
* **Atelier Colophon Backplate:** Custom architectural heritage press mark (Aster & Blanche Press, Lake Forest, IL) rendered at 300 DPI (`public/aster-blanche-backplate.png`, Handwrytten ID `751314`).
* **Guest Checkout:** Base $9.00 pricing including mailing, using Stripe. Apple Pay must be verified through the actual mobile purchase journey.
* **Zero-Spam Address Entry:** Clean inputs with standard HTML5 autofill (`shipping address-line1`, etc.) for 1-tap browser and Keychain autofill.

## Security & Secrets Management

> **Industry Best Practice Notice:** Never commit secrets, private tokens, or live production keys to version control.

* All confidential keys (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `HANDWRYTTEN_API_KEY`, Firebase Admin credentials) remain strictly server-side.
* Only public identifiers (`NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`) may be exposed to client bundles.
* In production, secrets are managed securely via **Google Cloud Secret Manager** and injected into Firebase App Hosting containers at runtime.
